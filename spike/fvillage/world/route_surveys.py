"""One truthful, renewable daily civic survey across four real districts.

Each accepted report must come from a mask physically at a supported landmark.
The pure state machine never invents an observation, moves a character, or
rewards XP. Four unique, signed reports change the public daily report from
incomplete to complete. Incomplete days become explicit historical outcomes.
